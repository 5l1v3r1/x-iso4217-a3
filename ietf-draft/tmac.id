This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any
kind.  Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested.
Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF).  Note that other groups may also distribute
working documents as Internet-Drafts.  The list of current Internet-
Drafts is at http://datatracker.ietf.org/drafts/current/.

Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

This document is an individual submission. Comments are solicited
and should be addressed to the author(s).

This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

This Internet-Draft will expire on \*[*XP].
